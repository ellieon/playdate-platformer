# It's a Platformer Game Innit
## Prerequisites

Make sure the [PlaydateSDK](https://play.date/dev/) is fully installed and the `PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set to the root of your PlaydateSDK directory and the Playdate SDK `bin` folder is on your path

* For example on MacOS your `~/.zshprofile` file should be updated to include the line `export PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH="$HOME/Developer/PlaydateSDK`)

It is possible to run this project using NPM which must be installed and available if you wish to do so

## For VSCode Users
The following extensions are reccomended:
* [Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=sumneko.lua)
* [Lua Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=jep-a.lua-plus)
* [Playdate Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=midouest.playdate-debug)

Also [LuaCATS](https://github.com/notpeter/playdate-luacats) should be available, by default the project looks for it in `~/Developer`. This is as simple as cloning `https://github.com/notpeter/playdate-luacats.git`to that directory. If you want to install LuaCATS anywhere else, make sure to update `workspace.library` in `.luarc.json` to the installation directory

## Developing
All code is located in the `source` folder, with `main.lua` being the entry point  and `source/scripts` containing all of the Lua scripts used by the game

Levels are designed in [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/), the project file for them is located at `source/levels/world.ldtk`

### Building
While in the root of the project simply run `pdc source`, this will create a file `source.pdx` which can then be opened in Playdate Simulator included with the SDK, or sideloaded onto your Playdate

## NPM Users

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn` / `pnpm`), start the watcher:

```sh
npm run start
```

This will run the `build` and `simulate` tasks whenever files change.

### Building
To build the game's `.pdx`:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can now preview the game in the Playdate Simulator with `npm run simulate`.
